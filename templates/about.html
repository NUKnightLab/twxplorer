  <h3>Sign In</h3>

You have to sign in before you can use twXplorer.  You do this using OAuth, which is an authentication protocol that alows users to approve applications to act on their behalf without sharing their password.  We only request read access (as opposed to read/write access).  The application can only read data and has no ability to update any user's information.  

The Twitter API is rate-limited, only allowing clients to make a limited number of calls per hour.  Unauthenticated calls are measured against the public facing IP of the server or device making the request.  Authenticated calls are measured against the access token used in the request.  Requiring the user to sign-in means each user will have a unique access token.  Therefore, the rate limits are applied per-user (as opposed to per-application).

Requiring sign in also allows us to save private, per-user data (e.g. saved results).

<h3>Search</h3>

This page allows you to retrieve tweets by query.  You enter a query in the search box, pick a language, and hit the search button.  We contact Twitter and attempt to get the 500 most recent tweets that match the query.  Then we analyze them and display the results.

The language selection will restrict the search to tweets in a given language.  Twitter offers "best-effort" language detection, which is very good but not perfect.

The Search API is not an exhaustive source of Tweets. Not all Tweets are indexed or made available.

<h3>Lists</h3>

This page allows you to retrieve tweets by lists.  The primary dropdown menu contains all the lists the authenticating user subscribes to, including their own (maximum of 100).  You select a list, pick a language, and hit the search button.  We contact Twitter and attempt to get the 500 most recent tweets authored by members of the selected list.  Then we analyze them and display the results.

<h3>Analysis</h3>

We take each tweet and break it down into a list of terms, hashtags, and links.  Then, we count the number of tweets that contain each term, hashtag, and link.  

Terms include unigrams (words), bigrams (two-word phrases), user mentions (e.g. @KnightLab), and hashtag text (e.g. "#chicago" counts as "chicago").   All terms except user mentions are stoplisted (ignore common words like "the") and stemmed (e.g. "look", "looking", and "looks" are counted as the same term).    

We throw out bigrams that only appear once.  Then, we look at the unigrams.  We do not count unigrams if they are part of a valid bigram.  For example, if a tweet contains the valid bigram "white house", then "white" and house" will not be counted separately as invidivual terms.

<h3>Results</h3>

We display the tweets that were found and the resulting histograms of terms, hashtags, and links. 

We try to only show unique tweets by hiding retweets.  However, the number next to each item in the histogram indicates the number of tweets in the set that contain that item, and this number will include any retweets that were actually returned by Twitter.

You can click on any item in a histogram, and it will appear above the histograms as a filter item.  The list of tweets and histograms always reflects the current filter state.  The filters are AND-ed together.  For example, if you have filtered separately by "chicago" and "bulls", the displayed results will reflect only those tweets that contain both "chicago" and "bulls".

You can remove the filter by clicking on its "x".  

<h3>History</h3>

You can save a set of results by clicking on the "Save Results" button.  You can view all of your saved result sets on the History page.

The result sets displayed by the date/time when you saved them and grouped by query or list (depending on how you obtained the results).  Click on any result set to review it.

A result set can be deleted by checking the box next to it and clicking the "Delete Selected Results" button.
